# Project

## Background

For the past few weeks, we have been learning about lists, inheritance, polymorphism, and recursion and using them to model parts of the CTA. For this project, we used these concepts to design and implement a program that models the entire CTA and allows users to create/remove stations, search for stations, and navigate between stations.


## The Problem

We created a program that models the CTA and allows users to interact with the data it contains

### User Interface

1.  Create a new station that is added to the CTA.
2.  Modify an existing station on the CTA.
3.  Remove a station from the CTA.
4.  Search for a station within the CTA when given a name by the user. This search should be able to return multiple stations if more than one has the same name.
5.  Finds the nearest station within the CTA when given a latitude and longitude by the user.
6.  Generates a path between two stations, specified by the user by their names. This means that your program may need to ask the user to clarify which station they mean when given a name that is shared by multiple stations. Your program should also be able to handle the situation where the stations are not on the same line and be able to indicate to the user where to switch from one line to another.
7.  Exits when the user requests to finish.

The user can be prompted to choose between the above options and can exit the menu with the appropriate choice. The verification of each operation is visible in the console.
