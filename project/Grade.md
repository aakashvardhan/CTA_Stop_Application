## Comments

Design looks fine.

1.  Your test plan doesn't mention route generation.
2.  No output file.
3.  Search requires the user to already know what line they are looking for rather than being able to search purely based on name.
4.  Adding a station does not allow you to specify where on the line it is.
5.  Path generation does not work at all.
6.  Your application class is one giant method making it difficult to read.
7.  You only have one comment in the entire program.
